Environment Setup

For each repository, a .env.example file is provided. To run the project, create a .env file by copying the .env.example file:

cp .env.example .env

to see swagger docs go to api_url / api

Note

I specialize more in backend development, particularly with NestJS, and I enjoy working with it. My frontend skills are not as strong, so I appreciate your understanding!
